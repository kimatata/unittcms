# Backend

## Set up database

```bash
npm run migrate
```

## Start backend server

```bash
npm run start
```

If you do not bother to place `.env` files, such as in a development environment, you can start the server with `npm run dev`.

## Database operation

The following commands may be useful when trying things out in development:

- drop tables: `npm run drop`
- insert seed data: `npm run seed`
