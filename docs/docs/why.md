# Why UnitTCMS

No matter the product, it is difficult to manage all testing with automated tests alone. Depending on the environment, Some portion of testing often involves manual test cases. In my team, we have been managing test cases using Excel. While Excel is a highly versatile tool, it is not specifically designed for test case management, which can make it inconvenient in certain scenarios.

For example,

- writing long test procedures can lead to oversized cells
- forced horizontal scrolling
- difficult to attach image files.
- the Excel file may become heavy
- Need to aggregate test cases and visualization
- Not ideal for simultaneous editing by multiple people.

Due to these challenges, it becomes clear that a dedicated tool is necessary when managing a substantial number of manual tests.

## Other tools

There are many test case management tools available in the market, which can be categorized into proprietary and open-source solutions.

Proprietary tools often come with modern, user-friendly interfaces but tend to be cloud-based, which may raise security concerns for some organizations. While some of them do offer on-premises options, these tend to be significantly more expensive.

There are also open-source tools, but many feature older user interfaces that involve frequent page reloads, which can hinder usability.

With these challenges in mind, I set out to develop a modern, user-friendly, open-source test case management tool that anyone can use for free in a secure, self-hosted environment.
