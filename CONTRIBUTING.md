# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We're excited to have you help improve and expand it.

Here are a few simple guidelines to get started:

## Submitting Issues

Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug, have a question, or want to suggest a feature. Please provide as much detail as possible.

## Pull Requests

The `main` branch is a snapshot of the latest production version. All development must be done in dedicated branches and will be merged to `development` branch.

### Steps

1. We recommend opening an issue first if you plan to work on a new feature or significant change, so we can discuss it.
1. Fork the unittcms repository
1. Create a new branch out of the `develop` branch.
1. When submitting a pull request, please ensure that your changes are well-tested and documented where necessary.
1. It is no problem to have multiple commits while working on the PR. We'll let GitHub squash it automatically before the merge.

## Thanks

Thank you for your contributions! Every issue reported and pull request submitted helps make this project better.
